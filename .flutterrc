# Flutter Configuration for Development
# Hardcode localhost:3000 for web development
# Note: This file is for reference. To use port 3000, run:
# flutter run -d chrome --web-port=3000

# Alternative: Create a launch configuration in VS Code
# Add this to .vscode/launch.json if you want to always use port 3000
